# Security Considerations

The "ietf-alto" and "ietf-alto-stats" YANG modules define data nodes that are designed to be accessed
via YANG based management protocols, such as NETCONF {{RFC6241}} and RESTCONF
{{RFC8040}}. Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-implement secure
transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual authentication.

The Network Access Control Model (NACM) {{RFC8341}} provides the means to
restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of all
available protocol operations and content.

There are a number of data nodes defined in these two YANG modules that are
writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the default).
These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
Write operations (e.g., edit-config) to these data nodes without proper protection
can have a negative effect on network operations. These are the subtrees and data
nodes in "ietf-alto" YANG module and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

  /alto/alto-client/server-discovery:
  : This subtree specifies a set of parameters for an ALTO client to discover ALTO servers.
  Unauthorized access to it could cause intruders to modify the ALTO discovery
  parameters (e.g., "dns-server") in order to expose an ALTO client to fake ALTO servers. Likewise, this data node can be manipulated to prevent an ALTO client from discovering a reachable ALTO server.

  /alto/alto-server/auth-client:
  : This list specifies all the authenticated ALTO clients on an ALTO server.
  Unauthorized write access to this list can allow intruders to modify the entries
  so as to add a client that have not been authenticated yet or delete a client
  that has already been authenticated. Likewise, this data node can be manipulated to prevent access of legitimate ALTO clients.

  /alto/alto-server/role:
  : This list specifies roles which authenticated ALTO clients were assigned to for
  access control. Unauthorized write access to this list allow intruders to
  modify the entries so as to permit access that should not be permitted, or deny
  access that should be permitted.

  /alto/alto-server/data-source/feed-interval:
  : This leaf specifies a period for an ALTO server to wait for updates published
  by a data source. A malicious ALTO client could attempt to set a very low (or large)
  value to this node. Setting a very low value could attack the data source.
  Setting a very large value would lead to maintaining stale data in the ALTO server.

  /alto/alto-server/data-source/poll-interval:
  : This leaf specifies a period for an ALTO server to proactively poll updates
  from a data source. A malicious client could attempt to set a very low (or large)
  value to this node. Setting a very low value could attack the data source.
   Setting a very large value would lead to maintaining stale data in the ALTO server.

Some of the readable data nodes in "ietf-alto" YANG module may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to
control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to these data
nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

  /alto/alto-server/logging-system:
  : This subtree provides configuration to select a logging system to capture log
  messages generated by an ALTO server. Unauthorized read access of this node
  can allow intruders to access logging information, which could be used to craft
  an attack the server.

The "ietf-alto" supports an HTTP listen mode to cover cases where the ALTO
server stack does not handle the TLS termination itself, but is handled by a
separate component. Special care should be considered when such mode is
enabled. Note that the default listen mode is "https".

Also, please be aware that these modules include choice nodes that can be augmented
by other extended modules. The augmented data nodes may be considered sensitive
or vulnerable in some network environments. For instance, an augmented case of
the "source-params" choice in "data-source" may include authentication
information about how to access a data source including private network
information. The "yang-datastore" case in [](#example-data-source) is such an
example. The "restconf" and "netconf" nodes in it may reveal the access to a
private YANG datastore. Thus, those extended modules may have the NACM
extension "default-deny-all" set.

These modules use groupings defined in other RFCs that
define data nodes that do set the NACM "default-deny-all" and
"default-deny-write" extensions.
