# Design Scope and Requirements {#sec-req}

## Scope of Data Model for ALTO O&M {#scope}

The following items are in the scope of the data models specified in this document:

- Deploying an ALTO server/client.
- Operating and managing an ALTO server/client.
- Functionality/capability configuration of ALTO services.
- Monitoring ALTO-related performance metrics.

This document does not define any data model related to specific
implementation, including:

- Data structures for how to store/deliver ALTO information resources (e.g.,
  database schema to store a network map).
- Data structures for how to store information collected from data sources.
  (e.g., database schema to store topology collected from an Interface to the
  Routing System (I2RS) client {{RFC7921}})

## Basic Requirements {#requirements}

Based on discussions and recommendations in {{RFC7285}} and {{RFC7971}}, the
data model provided by this document satisfies basic requirements listed in
[](#TableReq).

| --------------------------------------------------------------------------                          | --------------------------------------------------------- |

| R2: The data model should provide logging management.                                               | Section 16.2.1 of {{RFC7285}}                             |
| R3: The data model should provide ALTO-related management information.                              | Section 16.2.2 of {{RFC7285}}                             |
| R4: The data model should support configuration for security policy management.                     | Section 16.2.6 of {{RFC7285}}                             |
| R5-1: The data model should support configuration for different data sources.                       | Section 16.2.4 of {{RFC7285}}, Section 3.2 of {{RFC7971}} |
| R5-2: The data model should support configuration for information resource generation algorithms.   | Section 16.2.4 of {{RFC7285}}                             |
| R5-3: The data model should support configuration for access control at information resource level. | Section 16.2.4 of {{RFC7285}}                             |
| R6: The data model should provide metrics for server failures.                                      | Section 16.2.3 of {{RFC7285}}, Section 3.3 of {{RFC7971}} |
| R7: The data model should provide performance monitoring for ALTO-specific metrics.                 | Section 16.2.5 of {{RFC7285}}, Section 3.4 of {{RFC7971}} |

## Additional Requirements for Extensibility {#extra-req}

R8: As the ALTO protocol is extensible, the data model for ALTO O&M should
allow for augmentation to support potential future extensions.

## Overview of ALTO O&M Data Model for Reference ALTO Architecture

[](#alto-ref-arch) shows a reference architecture for the ALTO server
implementation and YANG modules that these server components need to implement.
The server manager, information resource manager and data source listeners need
to implement `ietf-alto.yang` (see [](#alto-model)). The performance monitor
and logging and fault manager need to implement `ietf-alto-stats.yang` (see
[](#alto-stats-model)).

The data broker and algorithm plugins are not in the scope of the data models
defined in this document. But user-specified YANG modules can be applied to
different algorithm plugins by augmenting the data model defined in this
document (see [](#alto-ext-model)).
