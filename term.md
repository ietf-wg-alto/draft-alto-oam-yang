module each name is defined. Otherwise, names are prefixed using the standard
prefix associated with the corresponding YANG module, as shown in [](#tbl-yang-prefixes).

|:-|:-|:-
| yang | ietf-yang-types | {{RFC6991}}
| inet | ietf-inet-types | {{RFC6991}}
| tcp | ietf-tcp-server | {{I-D.ietf-netconf-tcp-client-server}}
